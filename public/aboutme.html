    I went to college at Queensborough Community College. I originally wanted to be in Cyber Security, but I wanted to learn things like game development or wed design,
    so I decided to switch majors. I graduated with my associates in June 2024.

    I was born in Queens New York. My parents divorced when I was younger but kept close ties for my sake. Allowing me 2 families and siblings to interact with.
    I have 2 brothers and 4 sisters. Some are step sibligs but I consider them real family.

<p> I eventually want to code my own open world game based on the world of a famouse manga/anime called One Piece by Eiichiro Oda.
    Its my favorite anime, and I love to play video games.
